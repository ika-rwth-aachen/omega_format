# ![](./omega_format/visualization/ui/icon.svg) OMEGAFormat - Python Library
The OMEGAFormat is a data foramt for storing reference and perception data from pilotings, test drives and simulation in urban traffic (and highway). It stores object-list-based trajectory information about dynamic objects together with map information and more. This module enables the creation, and visualization of data conforming to this data format. Additionally, it can check files for conformance and perform basic sanity checks on the data and convert data in OpenDrive and LevelXData data format into the OMEGAFormat.

The OMEGAFormat itself is specified in the [OMEGAFormat specification](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega_format/tree/main/doc/specification.md) and [reference list of signals](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega_format/tree/main/doc/signal_list_reference.md).

The OMEGAFormat was developed in the [German VVMethods Project](https://www.vvm-projekt.de). For a detailed insight in the role of the OMEGAFormat for Validation and Verification of Automated Driving Systems proposed by VVMethods, take a look at [Deliverable 13: Scenario-based Model of the ODD through Scenario Databases](https://www.vvm-projekt.de/securedl/sdl-eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE3Mzg1NzcxNjcsImV4cCI6MTczODY2NzE2NywidXNlciI6MCwiZ3JvdXBzIjpbMCwtMV0sImZpbGUiOiJmaWxlYWRtaW4vdXNlcl91cGxvYWQvUGFwZXJzL0RlbGl2ZXJhYmxlMTMtU2NlbmFyaW8tYmFzZWRfTW9kZWxfb2ZfdGhlX09ERF90aHJvdWdoX1NjZW5hcmlvX0RhdGFiYXNlcy5wZGYiLCJwYWdlIjoyM30.gHKKVt8Ufaw54lPVu6UJAPucRkbHn822glI80KZPD0E/Deliverable13-Scenario-based_Model_of_the_ODD_through_Scenario_Databases.pdf)

# Installation
If you want an editable install (modifications to the files in the directory are immediately used by the module) run:
```
pip install -e .[visualization]
```

# Converters
The python library allows the conversion of following data formats into the OMEGAFormat.

- OpenDrive
- LevelXData [tested with inD, highD and exiD]

# Data Format
The base of both, the reference data format and the perception data format is the [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5) file format. This library utilizes [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/) to interact with those.

## Reference Data
The `OMEGAFormat reference recording` format is used to store data that represents the 'true' state of road users, infrastructure information, weather and more during a piloting, testing or simulation. The representation is on an object list basis.
The following diagram shows an overview of the hierarchy in the `OMEGAFormat reference recording` format. A more detailed description can be found in the [specification document](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega_format/tree/main/doc/specification.md) and the [signal list](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega_format/tree/main/doc/signal_list_reference.md).

## Perception Data
The `PerceptionRecording` format is used to store data that represents what a vehicle under test, sensor under test or similar perceives from its surroundings. It is designed to be compared against the `ReferenceRecording` format. The following diagram shows an overview of the hierarchy in the `PerceptionRecording` format. A more detailed description is coming soon.
